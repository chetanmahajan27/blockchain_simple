find /path/to/directory -type f -exec ls -lh {} + | sort -rhk 5

Let's break down the command:

find /path/to/directory: Specifies the directory where the search should start.
-type f: Filters only regular files (excluding directories and other special file types).
-exec ls -lh {} +: Executes the ls -lh command on each file found, which provides detailed information about the file, including its size.
|: Pipes the output of the ls command to the sort command.
sort -rhk 5: Sorts the output in reverse order (-r) based on the fifth field (-k 5), which corresponds to the file size. The -h flag enables human-readable sorting (e.g., 1K, 1M, 1G) instead of raw byte values.
